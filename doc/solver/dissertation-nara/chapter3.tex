\label{chap:mipformulation}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter describes a method for solving the problem which is purely based on mixed integer programming (MIP).

This approach divides the problem in two modules, which were called 'tactical' and 'operational' module.
