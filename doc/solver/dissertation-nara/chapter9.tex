\section{What did not work well}

Several practical issues emphasized by other authors were also identified during TRIEDA's development and were referenced along this work. Probably some challenges and problems faced both at solving methods development and deployment phase could have been avoided or at least minimized if we had a previous knowledge of these works.


A first approach divided the problem in two modules, which were called 'tactical' and 'operational' module.
